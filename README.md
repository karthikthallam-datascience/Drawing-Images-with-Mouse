This repository contains two files: you can either of the files to run the code

It contains 3 scripts: 

    1) Connecting a Function for Drawing
    
    2) Adding a functionality to an event in the function
    
    3) Dragging with Mouse directly
    
    
If you are using jupyter notebook then each script should be in a seperate cell and execute one cell to see the image window

If you are using .py file or script file then you have to run the code making sure to comment remaining 2 scripts provided in the file and use powershell to run the file
